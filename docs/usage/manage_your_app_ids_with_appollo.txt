Manage your app IDs with Appollo
================================

Here are some tips you can use to manage your app IDs.

Using the ``ls`` command line will return a list of all the App identifiers that are **currently linked** to your account.

If you wish to **remove an App ID**, you can use the ``rm --key TEXT`` command.

.. note::
  **The app ID is removed (unlinked) from Appollo but not from the App Store.**

For existing App IDs, the following command, allows you to link them to your Appollo account.

  ``appollo app import --name TEXT --bundle-id TEXT --account-id TEXT``

Furthermore, if you need to **link** or **unlink** an App to a **specific Appollo team**, you can use this command:

  ``appollo app link --key TEXT --team-name TEXT``

Linking an App with a team will **grant access** to all the team members.
