2. How to connect to your build and setup Xcode for a Flutter app
=================================================================

In this chapter, you will learn how to **connect to your configuration build** and **configure Xcode** 
with the help of Appollo to **build your app**.

Use RustDesk to connect to your configuration build
---------------------------------------------------

Now that your configuration build is ready and that you received your credentials, you can connect to your Mac virtual machine.

.. tip::
    If you try to connect a build that was not meant for remote desktop or that was stopped, no problem, 
    Appollo will suggest you to create one automatically.

For this step, you need a remote desktop access application. For Appollo, the one used is **RustDesk's** |rustdesk_client|.

Launch RustDesk, it should look like the following screenshot.

**The first step is to click on the three little dots and select 'ID/Relay Server'.**

Type in Appollo's relay server: **appollo.space**

This step is to make sure you are connected to Appollo's relay server.

Secondly, simply enter the **RustDesk ID** you were given to authenticate.

Finally, RustDesk will ask you to enter the **RustDesk password** you received.

That's it ! You are now connected to an Appollo-Remote build machine in remote desktop.

**You can now freely configure Xcode!**

.. tip::
    If you can not see the entire desktop, do not worry, there is a shrink option in the settings.

Debug and test your Flutter app in the iOS simulator
----------------------------------------------------

Debugging and testing your iOS app is fairly easy with Appollo.

**Once you are on the Appollo-Remote**, an instance of the Simulator is ready for you.

You can **open the terminal** on the Appollo-Remote.

Go into your app using ``cd Documents/app`` and use the ``flutter run`` command.

Wait a few instants and the app should start on the simulator, you can now debug and test it.

.. tip::
  You have access to everything you need!
