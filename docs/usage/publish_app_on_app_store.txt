======================================
Publish a flutter app on the App Store
======================================

To publish an app, head over to |app_store_connect| and create a new iOS app.

**Select the bundle ID of one of your App IDs**.

Once this is done, in **Appollo**, you can create a **publication** build with ``appollo build start``.

You will need to wait around **10 to 15 minutes** before Apple sends you an email confirming that your build has been processed.

You can now add that build to your app.
