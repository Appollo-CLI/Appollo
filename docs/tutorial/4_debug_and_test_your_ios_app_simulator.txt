4. How to debug and test your Flutter app in the iOS simulator
==============================================================

Debugging and testing your iOS app is fairly easy with Appollo.

For this tutorial, you will have to start a build with a **configuration build type**. 

Why use a configuration build type ?
This is because this build type allows you to connect to the Appollo-Remote with the RustDesk protocol used previously in
the tutorial.

So, type in ``appollo build start`` in your terminal and enter **configuration**.

Let Appollo start the build, once ready, you can **connect to the Appollo-Remote with your credentials**

.. note::
    For this step, you need a remote desktop access application. For Appollo, the one used is **RustDesk's** |rustdesk_client|.

    Launch your software, indicate the **RustDesk ID** you were given and connect.

Once you are on the Appollo-Remote, an instance of the Simulator is ready for you.

You can open the terminal on the Appollo-Remote.

Go into your app using ``cd Documents/app`` and use the ``flutter run`` command.

Wait a few instants and the app should start on the simulator, you can now debug and test it.
