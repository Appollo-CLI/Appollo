3. How to create an App ID using Appollo
========================================

In Appollo, you can directly **manage your App IDs**. Thanks to the ``appollo app`` subcommands.

The first thing you should do, if you have not yet, is to **take notice of your account-key** by using the ``appollo apple ls`` command.

The key is located in the first part of the table. It is the key that was created when you linked your Apple Developer Account to Appollo.

Make a new App ID
-----------------

You can **create a new one** using:

.. code-block:: none

  appollo app mk --name TEXT --bundle-id TEXT --account-key TEXT

The **name** is simply the one you want to give to the identifier.

The |bundle_id|, is a unique key for your app on the App Store (e.g.: com.company.appname)

And finally, your **Appollo account-key**.

Other subcommands
-----------------

Using the ``ls`` command line will return a list of all the App identifiers that are **currently linked** to your account.

If you wish to **remove an App ID**, you can use the ``rm --key TEXT`` command.

.. note::
  **The app ID is removed (unlinked) from Appollo but not from the App Store.**

For existing App IDs, the following command, allows you to link them to your Appollo account.

  ``appollo app import --name TEXT --bundle-id TEXT --account-id TEXT``

Furthermore, if you need to **link** or **unlink** an App to a **specific Appollo team**, you can use this command:

  ``appollo app link --key TEXT --team-name TEXT``

Linking an App with a team will **grant access** to all the team members.

Extra resources
---------------

If you need to, you can access a list of your existing App IDs.

For that, go over to your |apple_developer_account|, then to the **"Certificates, Identifiers & Profile"** menu.

There, you will find the **"Identifiers menu"** that contains the list with the possibility to create new ones.
