4. How to retrieve your updates from Appollo-Remote locally
===========================================================

For this next part, make sure your configuration build is stopped by pressing the **Stop build** button.

You will have two possibilities to retrieve the changes you made in Appollo Remote locally.

$$Might change!!

    1. **If you use Git** for your project the easiest is to use the $$Add button name button which will `Retrieve changes with a patch file`_.
    2. Otherwise, you can `Retrieve changes by downloading the project files`_ locally with the $$Add button name button.


Retrieve changes with a patch file
----------------------------------

When your build is stopped, you can create the patch using the **Download Patch (1)** button.

By default, the file is called **appollo.patch** and is located in your app folder.

To apply the changes, use the **Apply Patch (2)** button.

Retrieve changes by downloading the project files
-------------------------------------------------

When your build is stopped, you can get your files as a zip file by using the $$Button name.

Unzip the files and you get the last version of your source code as edited in XCode.
