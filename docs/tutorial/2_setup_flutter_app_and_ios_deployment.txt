2. How to connect to your configuration build
=============================================

In this chapter, you will learn how to **connect to your configuration build**

Use RustDesk to connect to your configuration build
---------------------------------------------------

You must download |rustdesk| to connect to your Configuration build.

Now that your configuration build is ready and Rustdesk installed, you can directly connect to your Mac virtual machine. Odevio will launch Rustdesk by its own.

**If, for some reason, you were not able to connect to your build directly from Odevio, follow the next steps:**

For this step, you need a remote desktop access application. For Odevio, the one used is |rustdesk|.

Launch Rustdesk, it should look like the following screenshot.

**The first step is to click on the three little dots, this will open the settings and go into the Network settings**

Type in Odevio's relay server: **odevio.com**

This step is to make sure you are connected to Odevio's relay server.

Finally, RustDesk will ask you to enter the **RustDesk password** you received.

That's it ! You are now connected to an Odevio-Remote build machine in remote desktop.
