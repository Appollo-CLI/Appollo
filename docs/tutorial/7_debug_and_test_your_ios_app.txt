7. How to debug and test your iOS app without a Mac (or with one) - The easy way
================================================================================

Debugging and testing your iOS app is fairly easy with Appollo. **Even if you do not have a Mac**.

For this tutorial, you will have to start a build with a **configuration build type**

So, type in ``appollo build start KEY`` in your terminal and enter **configuration**.

.. tip:: If you forgot the key of one of your apps, you can always use the command ``appollo app ls``.

Let Appollo start the build, you can follow the progress with ``appollo build detail KEY``.

Now that your build started with success, you can connect to it with ``appollo build connect KEY``.

Complete the given information within your remote desktop application to access the virtual machine.

Once you are on the virtual desktop, you can launch the simulator.

It might take some time to boot if it is the first time you are using it.

In parallel, you can also start an instance of the terminal on the virtual machine.

Go into your app using ``cd Documents/app``. and use the ``flutter run`` command.

Wait a few instants and that is how you can access your app on the remote desktop to debug and test it.
