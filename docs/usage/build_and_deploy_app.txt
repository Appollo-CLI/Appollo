Build and Release Flutter apps on iOS
=====================================

To build a Flutter app on iOS, you can use the ``appollo build start`` command.

You can specify any build at this point except **configuration** so you can have an **IPA file**

Once the status of your build is **succeeded**, you can retrieve the **IPA file**.

For that, use ``appollo build ipa``.

Use an **ad-hoc** build type if you want to use your app on an registered device.

.. warning:: For the device to be used, it must be registered **before** you make the build. Otherwise,
             you will not be able to install the app.
