3. How to create an App ID using Appollo
========================================

What is an App ID ?
-------------------

It is the combination of your **Team ID** and the **bundle ID**. The Team ID is the one you can find in your membership
information and is supplied by Apple. The bundle ID is the one you define and is a **unique identifier**.
It is a unique key for your app on the App Store (**the bundle id should look like this : com.company.appname**)

In Appollo, you can directly **manage your App IDs**. Thanks to the ``appollo app`` subcommands.

The first thing you should do, if you have not yet, is to **take notice of your account-key** by using the ``appollo apple ls`` command.

The key is located in the first part of the table. It is the key that was created when you linked your Apple Developer Account to Appollo.

Make a new App ID
-----------------

You can **create a new one** using:

.. code-block:: none

  appollo app mk --name TEXT --bundle-id TEXT --account-key TEXT

The **name** is simply the one you want to give to the identifier.

The bundle ID (e.g.: com.yourcompany.yourapp)

And finally, your **Appollo account-key**.

Now, you can access a list of your existing App IDs.

For that, go over to your |apple_developer_account|, then to the **"Certificates, Identifiers & Profile"** menu.

There, you will find the **"Identifiers menu"** that contains the list with the possibility to create new ones.
