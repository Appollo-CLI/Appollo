1. Create your first Appollo build
==================================

If you are here, it means that you managed to install Appollo and have created your account.

You are almost there, this is the first and last step of this tutorial to create your first build.

It is really easy, you just need to **use this one command**:

``appollo build start``

.. note::
    Make sure you are in the root folder of your app!

**Choose the configuration type:**

|

Now, select the **No application (Xcode will not be configured) option.**

You will also see a list of your existing apps if this is the case.

Appollo will prepare your build in a few moments!

Let's hop on to the next chapter of our tutorial to learn how to connect and setup Xcode for your build.

.. note::
    If you have an Apple developer account and App ID(s), check out our tutorial on  :doc:`how to link your account <6_configure_app_store_connect>` and 
    :doc:`how to create an app ID <7_how_to_make_an_app_id_using_appollo>` using Appollo.

.. tip::
    If the build fails you can easily access the logs of your build with the command ``appollo build logs`` and select
    the build for which you want to view the logs.

.. tip::
    If you closed your terminal while your app was building you can execute ``appollo build detail`` and select the last
    build and you will have a detailed view of the build's status. Builds do not stop if the ``appollo build start``
    command is killed.
