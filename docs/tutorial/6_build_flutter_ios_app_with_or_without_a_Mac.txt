6. How to build an iOS app without a Mac (or with one) - The easy way
=====================================================================

In this section of the tutorial, you are going to learn how to effectively build your app to retrieve the **IPA** file.
And dowload your app on an apple device to test it.

You can use the command ``appollo build start`` but this time the **build type** is going to be **ad-hoc**.

.. tip:: If you add ``--help`` you will see all the different options you have to configure your build. For example,
         you can choose the build version.

Your build is being created. Grab a coffee, it can take a few minutes.

You can always check the status with ``appollo build detail KEY``.

Your build can have different status, here they are in order:

1. Created: Your build was created but the remote instance has not started yet

2. In progress:

  a. Starting instance: The instance is booting up

  b. Preparing build: Loading the different certificates

  c. Building: Your app is being created

  d. Getting build result: The patch is created as well as the IPA file

  e. Publishing: Sending app on the app store

3. Succeeded

When your build has succeeded, you can use the command ``appollo build ipa KEY``

You will be given an URL. If you use it in a browser, it will download the file.

You can also use the URL on a **registered device** of your Apple developper account to download the app.

.. tip:: To register a new device, visit |apple_device|.

.. warning:: For the device to be used, it must be registered **before** you make the build. Otherwise,
             you will not be able to install the app.

And that is how you can build an app with or without a Mac to download and try it.
